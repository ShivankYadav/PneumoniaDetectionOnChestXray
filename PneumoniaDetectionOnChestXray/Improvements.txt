List of improvements suggested by Udacity Reviewer.

1. [Done] Edema and Consolidation might be confused with Pneumonia. At last of EDA. This is something you can use in your FDA report on 
	limitations.
2. [Done] Your Training Loss was still falling steeply; it would have helped to conduct more training until this loss becomes 'stable'.
	You might want to increase your learning rate so the loss settles down more quickly.
3. [Done] After defining the different parameters on DICOM header, they should be tested on the 6 images to see which of the images indeed has 
	the properties we have defined or not.
	Note: for the predictions of Pneumonia you did absolutely great work there so now it's just to run the DICOM test on the images 
	to see which of them passes the test and which doesn't.
	Hint: As there are 6 images 3 of them passed the test while 3 other failed i.e the others that failed have a property that is
 	not defined on the DICOM header.

	DICOM images to ensure that image position, image type, and body part are acceptable. 
	In this test dataset, three of the images do not meet this standard.

4. [Done] clinical impact section: bring out impacts on how a FN and a FP prediction will affect the patients. 
	Does one have more impact than the other?

5. [Done] It would be helpful to add it can be used for both genders under 'Indications for Use'.
6. [Done] In DICOM checking steps in FDA Submission, there is a need to describe the DICOM checks that you perform before sending an image through your algorithm, 
	e.g. checking of image position, image type, and body part examined.

7. [Done] Change the age distribution range.
